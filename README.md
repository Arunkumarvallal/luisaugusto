I am a fullstack developer working at a [creative agency](https://www.hdmz.com/) using the LAMP stack, building websites and applications for companies in the medical and biotech fields. On personal projects, I lean towards a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) with Node and Vue/Nuxt/Vuex, relying on API integrations and static site generators.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Internal projects at work built on [Pimcore](https://pimcore.com/en)
- Building up my online presence through [blogging](https://dev.to/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/legendofluis)
- A few personal projects, like a small social network for family members, an interactive site for hiking trails, and an NPM package

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- React - After so many years of using Vue, I figured it would be also good to see what it's like developing with a different framework. It'll also give me a chance to understand JSX and CSS-in-JS.
- TypeScript - Currently finding ways to introduce it into my applications.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

- Open source projects built with JS, especially ones that use React or TypeScript
- Resolving issues with CSS layouts and responsiveness, Nuxt/Vue, or other JS bugs

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:

Finding ways to meet and connect with other developers, especially during the limbo of quarantines and lockdowns. I have always been recommended to find a mentor, and would love to hear from other people's experiences in those types of programs.

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

- Ways you can improve your lighthouse scores
- How to get the most out of CSS Grid and Flexbox Layouts
- How you can preserve the planet and reduce your carbon footprint.

## âš¡ Fun facts:

I have a Bachelors in Music Production & Engineering, which helped nourish my interests in creativity and design. I later translated those skillsets into programming and web development, and I have enjoyed building cool things for over 8 years now.
